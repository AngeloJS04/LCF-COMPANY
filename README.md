Web Application on computer repair services.
This is my first web application where I apply what I learn about JS, Node, express.
The frontend application is almost finished using a template engine for HTML and bootstrap for CSS
NOW is the time to work with the backend while I learn on the road.

On the server side is running node with express and the form using a module called nodemailer that sends the information to my email
